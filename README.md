# Human-Activity-Recognoition-from-Ambient-Sensor-Data
Human activity recognition is a challenging time series classification problem. It involves predicting the movement of a subject purely from data collected from sensors and traditionally requires the deep domain expertise and involvement from signal processing to understand raw data and fit a predictive model. In latest developments, deep learning techniques like CNN and RNN bring out state-of-art results by self-learning features from the available raw sensor data. The objective is to recognize the activities of people who volunteered for the collection of data from various sensors placed at different spots in their homes. So, using the input sensorial data - Multivariate, Sequential, Time-Series, we need to classify them into one of the below labels:
classes = ['Toilet', 'Leave_Home', 'Enter_Home', 'Cook_Dinner', 'Eat_Dinner', 'Sleep', 'Watch_TV', 'Work_At_Table']
